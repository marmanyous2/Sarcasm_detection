# Sarcasm Detection

Recent years have seen a huge growth in the use of
social media platforms by the people to voice their opinion about
a variety of topics, which may lead to comments being ambiguous.
For example, sometimes some comments might be misunderstood
and may lead to conflict between the reader and the writer. A
similar kind of pattern has been seen when it comes to Newspaper
headlines or any comment or post on social media. We come
across a lot of writing materials throughout the day and while
some of them are very straightforward, some can be sarcastic.
This may seem offensive to certain groups of readers and result
in misunderstanding the subtle nature of humor added to the
headlines. Therefore, there is a need to separate the headlines
or comments or any writing in general, based on their nature as
sarcastic or non-sarcastic. This Project work helps to address this
problem by predicting headlines to be sarcastic or not. We applied
different Machine learning models and performed a comparative
analysis between them. We found that the Long short-term
memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network(CNN) gave
almost similar result with 82% accuracy.
